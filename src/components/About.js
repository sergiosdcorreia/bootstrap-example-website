                <p><strong>Arts and Design</strong> was always his passion. He started in High School by joining the Arts and Crafts course.
                There he learned how to draw and paint with different tools and techniques.</p>
                <p>He also loved the geometry classes, which helped him to make the decision of studying <strong>Architecture</strong> in college, where he stayed for 3 years.
                There he improved his design skills, especially hand drawing and 3D modeling.</p>

                <p>Later on he joined the <strong>Digital Arts and Multimedia</strong> course at another college.
                There he got most of his knowledge in design skills. Photography, Video, 3D Modeling and 2D/3D animations as well as the one that he focus on the most, Web Design.</p>
                <p>What he founded fascinating about <strong>Web Design</strong> was that he could use all of his design skills to create engaging user interfaces and user experiences for the web.
                For that he needed some programming knowledge so that's why he started to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

                <p>No one is perfect and one of his imperfections is communication and socializing. So he started to dance Lindy Hop in 2015.
                It's an American social dance that was born in New York in the 20's. It has evolved with the Jazz music of that time. This helps him to socialize, have some fun and make some friends.</p>
                <p>Other of his hobbies is photography, he self-taught himself since 2013. He shots landscapes, cities, and sometimes the dance events.
